This program aims to identify two haplotype sequences within a genome assembly guided by a reference genome. A common problem in genome assembly of heterozygous genome using Illumina short reads is two haploid genome were assembled separately. The detection of these sequences is very important and interesting to some biologists, e.g. studying the origins, mutations and structural variations between the two haploid genomes especially from a hybrid species and investigating X-linked and Y-linked genes etc.
